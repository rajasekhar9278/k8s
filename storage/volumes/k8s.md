* K8s is an open-source container orchestration tool or system that is used to automate tasks suck as the management, monitoring, scaling and deployment of containerized applications. It is used to manage several containers (since it can handle grouping of containers) which provides logical units that can be discovered and managed

3. What is orchestration when it comes to software and devops
* orchestration refers to the integration of multiple servers that allows them to automate processes or synchronize information in timely fashion. for example you have six or seven microservices for your application to run if you place them in seperate containers, this would invetably create obstacles for communication. orchestration will help you in such a situation by enabling all services in individual containers to work seemlessly to accomplish a single goal
